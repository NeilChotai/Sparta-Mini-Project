      <h3> Football </h3>
      <p> Played football since I was 7 years old. Made the school football team where we made it to the Leicestershire finals when I was 10 which was played at Filbert Street. After this game, two of us were approached by Leicester City scouts to come to the youth academy. Unfortunately moved schools and didn't continue playing football. I started to play again aged 14 and discovered a hidden talent as a 5-a-side keeper when I wasn't fit enough to play outfield on my return. Played for an under 16s team in Nottingham before playing 5-a-side socially for a few more years and then attempting to play sunday league, which didn't last a season. After going back to playing socially I finally joined the Aston University Hindu Society football team as they were looking for a keeper. They had yearly tournaments aginast 64 universities which we managed in my 2nd year getting through the knockouts by penalties in every round. The clip below is the shootout from the Finals.</p>

      <p>Proud season ticket holder for the best club in the world, the champions of England, Leicester city. </p>
